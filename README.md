A python application meant to support the process of planning time for events between people of potentially different timezones. It allows users to create and join a room, where each person can mark blocks of time as being available, reserved on a particular date, and reserved on repeatable basis. The app automatically converts saved times to the timezone of the user, based on their system time.
